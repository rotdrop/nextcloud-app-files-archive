# nextcloud-vue-components
A loose collection of Vue components that I use in several of my projects.

The purpose of this repository is to factor out common code that I use in several other Nextcloud apps.

**This is public, so you are invited to use these things, but I do not plan to make this a well-maintained Vue library.**
