## [1.2.3] - 2024-03-30

### Fixed

- restore PHP 8.1 compatibility

## [1.2.1] - 2024-03-21

### Fixed

## [1.2.0] - 2024-03-17

### Added

- Support Nextcloud v28, in particular use the new event-bus as the
  old legacy file-list is no longer available.

### Changed

- Reduce the size of the JS assets needed to hook in to the files-app sidebar

- Use latest @nextcloud/vue toolkit.

- Drop support for Nextcloud <= v27. The differences in the files-API
  are just too big.

  of the potentionally large and complicated archive file.

  and this app.

## Fixed

## [1.0.5] - 2022-11-12

## [1.0.4] - 2022-11-12

### Fixed

- Nextcloud is missing some prominent MIME-type mappings. Add them.
- Performance for large archives -- partly. This is still an issue,
  but has been improved
- Correctness of file-listing if underlying archive file has changed.

### Added

- expose the back-end driver name in the side-bar menu to ease debugging

## [1.0.3] - 2022-11-10

### Fixed

- File-cache inconsistency causing mount-points not showing up in UI
- Avoid using NelexaZip as archive-backend for ZIP-archives as it
  causes problems at least with archives generated by the `zipper`
  app.

### Added

- Optionally strip a common path prefix when mounting or extracting
  archives. This is meant for the not unsual case when the archive
  content is wrapped into a top-level directory.
- templates for the mount/extraction folder names via user preferences
- conflict resolution if the target mount point / extraction folder
  already exists
